# BERT-Sentiment-Analysis
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a natural language processing model from Google and its key technical innovation is applying the bidirectional training of Transformer to language modelling. The model is trained on IMDb reviews using PyTorch deep learning framework and achieves 92% accuracy in determining positive/negative reviews. The model can be trained with another dataset to recognise a broader range of human emotions

To get the model file, you can either  
- Run Sentiment_Analysis/Transformers for Sentiment Analysis.ipynb (Recommended to run it on GPU environment. For cloud GPU, look for Kaggle/Google Collab)
- Download [Bert-model.pt](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N776W6UBdMiMbBaa91IGDKh8BlKUXqmj?usp=sharing) and place it in your working directory
